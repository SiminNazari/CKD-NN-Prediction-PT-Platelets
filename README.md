# CKD-ML-Prediction-PT-Platelets

This repository contains the code and trained models used in our study:
**"Neural Network-Based Analysis of Clinical and Demographic Variables for Predicting Platelet Counts and Prothrombin Time in Chronic Kidney Disease Patients"**.

The project leverages deep learning models to predict two critical hematological parameters—Prothrombin Time (PT) and Platelet Count—in chronic kidney disease (CKD) using clinical and demographic variables.

The repository is organized into separate folders for each prediction target (PT and Platelets), with tailored data preprocessing, neural network training, SHAP-based model interpretation, performance evaluation scripts, and the best trained models saved for reuse.

This resource is shared in accordance with FAIR principles to support reproducibility and reuse.  
All code is implemented in Python using TensorFlow and is ready to run.
